Unrestricted by genre, the Roadburn line up regularly champions scene-defining bands and pioneers alongside up and coming artists who blur the boundaries effortlessly. Despite it’s well-regarded reputation and broad critical acclaim, Roadburn remains something of a boutique festival, and very much underground in ethos but with seriously big-league production values. Roadburn takes place each April in the Dutch city of Tilburg. The epicentre of the festival is the 013 venue, with other local venues making up the constellation that houses the festival acts. The festival is very much embraced by the local community; local business and enterprises engage with the spirit of Roadburn and the visitors to the city. Roadburn has approximately 4,500 attendees each day of the festival (a little less on the Sunday), with roughly 75% of visitors traveling from outside of The Netherlands. In addition to the ticket buyers, Roadburn attracts a wide range of press and industry figures who have helped develop Roadburn as a hub for creative and business endeavours. At the core of Roadburn is a desire to push the boundaries of art; to facilitate challenging performances, to encourage collaboration and to create true once-in-a-lifetime experiences for everybody at the festival – be they participating from the audience or on the stage. “Roadburn is a completely different experience than the traditional music festival. It is a small, intimate, extremely well-organized festival, put together by people who love the bands, and thrive on creating a unique social vibe where the lines between artist, audience, and staff are often completely blurred” – Steve Von Till / Neurosis."

For 4 years clubbers travelled from near, far and wide to dance at Scotland's clubbing Mecca; if you went to the Pleasuredome in Irvine, Expo in Kilmarnock, Metro in Saltcoats and the Piv in Ayr then you were one of those original Ayrshire 90s Ravers. Life long friendships were made on that dance floor and those clubbers became the STREETrave Family.You do not not want to miss this event packed full of your STREETrave heroes and dance music royalty.See you down the beach front!"

Located deep in the Southern Uplands in a river valley on Knockengorroch farm, the area was recently awarded Dark Skies status - one of the best places on the planet to see the stars... and see the stars you will... The musical line-up is a melting pot of world, folk, fusion and dub reggae with electronica, hip-hop and drum n bass thrown in for good measure - both live and DJed. As well as music, cabaret, spoken word, comedy and dance all take place across five venues, from the mighty open air stage, turf roofed and built from locally sourced timber, to a Berber tent, to the Celtic Longhouse venue, a willow wattled re-creation of an iron age dwelling.   There is a sauna, dedicated children's activities, workshops in arts, crafts, heritage and environmental subjects, fire shows, flash mobs, real ales, 'knocktails' and food stalls.  Knockengorroch even has its own ale the 'Knock Ale' and its own chocolate 'chocengorroch'.  The Knockengorroch Festival site was a populated village in ancient times and the festival re-populates the valley for the four days of the event.  The festival's motif of a highland cow is a reminder of the ancient beasts that the people in times gone depended on and worshipped. Run by a family who either live or grew up at Knockengorroch, and presided over by the family's cows who witness the festival fun from the safe confines of the opposite river bank. Knockengorroch Festival is set to be a whole world unto itself and one you may not want to leave.  "

Thankfully, in 2002, the festival was revived, and has continued to expand with each passing year, and gain more fans as it goes. The Isle of Wight festival has attracted such world beating acts as Jimi Hendrix, The Rolling Stones, Muse, Robert Plant, David Bowie, The Who, R.E.M, Bruce Springsteen, Pearl Jam, and Coldplay to name just a few. In fact, Isle of Wight has gained a reputation for the stellar lineup it constantly attracts, and the electric atmosphere it breeds. With its headliners proving to be more diverse with each year, with previous including the likes of Labrinth, Lewis Capaldi, and Katy B, the festival has been drawing in an ever growing demographic of fans, all maintaining the welcoming attitude that permeates the Newport venue. Isle of Wight is now well and truly established as one of the big festivals of the year.  "

        "festival_about": "Imagine, a music festival without mud. Where people open gates for you, say “excuse me” and move aside to let you to the bar. The tantalising aromas of great food mix with the nostalgic smell of steam from the resident railway, conjuring up memories of a bygone industrial age. Where both young and old come to share new music experiences, together. Where the sound of live music is everywhere whilst you wander through a fascinating museum dedicated to life in Rural England. And where fans laugh, smile and nod to each other with a familiarity gained only from their mutual annual pilgrimage. Sound too good? Not so. That’s Weyfest. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Weyfest is more like a mini-holiday than a music festival. It is a stress-free weekend in the country, with over 30 hours of the finest music from 4 stages, camping, posh loos, friendly staff and plenty to occupy the kids with music-, drama- and creative arts workshops; train rides; the popular Sci-Fi Zone and Outdoor Laser Combat and the many attractions offered by the venue itself - The Rural Life Museum, Tilford, set in the outstanding natural beauty of the Surrey Hills. You can stretch out your picnic rugs or wander around the site to the 4 stages with your camping chairs. Sit and watch your favourite band or discover new artists from the eclectic mix on offer, or just find a quiet spot to watch the world go by. The festival attracts new people every year - many of whom have not been to a festival for years for fear of mud and rude or drunken behaviour (there's none of that here!) and many who have never even been to a music festival before! Most have made new friends and now return each year for a reunion. The venue itself is a major reason for Weyfest’s increasing popularity. The Rural Life Museum is a working museum, littered with artefacts of past country life and craft displays throughout the venue. A working light railway runs both steam and diesel trains around the perimeter of the venue and because the venue is so compact everything is within easy reach. No trudging for miles from the car park or campsite, no long walks between stages ... and no major journey to reach the excellent food and bars. Once bitten you will truly be smitten!!!   Disabled access information   Are there any concessions for the disabled? A. We assume that, whereas the disabled person wants to come to Weyfest, the carer may not and so, on the production of proof of disability at the box office on arrival, the carer will be entitled to purchase a carer ticket at half of the gate price. This is limited to one carer for disabled persons over the age of 16 for festival entry only and does not include camping or campervan passes. Where it is imperative that a second carer is necessary to accompany the disabled person, documentation to that effect must be presented to the Box Office staff on arrival.

Springing up annually like a wild flower in the Cumbrian meadows, Solfest has evolved continually since its inception in 2003, transitioning from a local shindig, into one of the best loved of the UK's independent festivals. Run by a dedicated team and a small army of volunteers, Solfest has stayed true to its anti-corporate roots. This means that art and decor take the place of ubiquitous advertising and the international big names on the mainstage don't drown out the voices of the hidden gems. Solfest is all about eclecticism and although nothing shouts that louder than their handpicked line-ups, spanning genres and eras of music, that most certainly isn't where it stops. A broad group of very talented people come together each year at Solfest, to create an immersive environment with everything from a creative kid's area, to an array of interactive site art and even a Healing Garden where you can meditate, do some Yoga or participate in a Shamanic ritual! Solfest is founded on the idea that what truly makes a festival great is the crowd... That's right, YOU. You are the driving force and over the years they've been proud to see that the spirit of inclusion they strive for has not been lost to the Solfest community. Punks and ravers, grannies and toddlers, whoever you are or wherever you're from, Solfest has something for you. The fans own Solfest, whether you're a musician looking to play, a performer looking to show off your skills, an artist keen to help make the space come alive or you're simply looking for somewhere to dance, your collaboration defines the festival. Solfest returns for its 20th Anniversary at North Lakes Country Park, with a whole host of surprises down memory lane!    "

You can expect all the best House & Techno artists from the main Shall Not Fade imprint, as well as some of the biggest names from their Time Is Now label playing all things Garage, Breaks & Jungle. This will be the biggest lineup they’ve ever curated & they can’t wait to share it with you soon. As well as 3 days of high quality music, they also have an on:site pub, a fully functioning restaurant serving breakfast every morning and doing roast dinners on Sunday, music industry & production talks with some of the scenes leading voices, pop-up food traders, indoor chillout rooms, access to all the rooms in the mansion (except for private bedrooms), fully functioning showers & flushable toilets, amongst many other things.  This year's edition will be extremely intimate with only 500 tickets being made available. The previous two day festivals attracted 2000+ people on each occasion so we expect this to sell out VERY quickly. Shall Not Fade Festival is 100% independent and if you’ve been to one of their previous events you know the emphasis // love they put into delivering a high quality party.  Festival coaches will be available from Bristol & London, more information on that to follow. For info contact - info@shallnotfade.co.uk Hotel room packages are also available which include breakfast each day at the on:site restaurant, please contact the festival directly for prices // to book - they have rooms that can sleep anything from 2 people to 8 people.

The festival’s inaugural lineup in 2022 featured My Chemical Romance, Paramore, and Avril Lavigne, and was eventually expanded to three days due to overwhelming demand. 2023 was an altogether more pop-punk affair with titans of the genre Green Day and Blink 182 headlining. For every scene kid glued to Kerrang! during the mid 2000s, this is the festival for you. So grab your eyeliner, put on your Converse, and trek to the Nevada desert to relive the good times."

        "festival_about": "Europe's biggest indoor metal festival will host its 19th edition at BEC Arena, Manchester, on Saturday, 2nd November, 2024. (11am till midnight) Damnation started in Manchester in 2005, in a place called Jilly’s Rockworld, which is now a Tesco, and one in 2006 too, both years sold out at a thousand capacity. From Manchester, Damnation then moved to venues in Leeds and spent the vast majority of it's history there, selling out at the 2500 - 3000 mark regularly, but again found the restrictions of venue size to be an issue for accommodating demand. Fast forward to 2021, where the decision was made to move to BEC Arena in Manchester, where the place was absolutely packed, and had some amazing sets. Damnation has grown organically in size, stature with an ever-growing fanbase over the years, and following a phenomenal response to 2023 they look forward to 2024's edition that will mark it's 19th year."
